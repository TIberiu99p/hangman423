## Project Description
The **Hangman** game is a Python-based interactive implementation of the classic word guessing game. In this version, the computer selects a word, and the user attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a limited number of tries. This project showcases skills in Python programming, including functions, loops, conditional statements, and input validation. Key learnings include efficient code organization, handling user input, and implementing game logic.

## Milestone 1
Environment set up 

## Milestone 2
Create variables for the game
`milestone_2.py`

## Milestone 3
Check if the guessed character is in the word
`milestone_3.py`

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
